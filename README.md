# css-menu
CSS/HTML sliding side menu for a project

Single column menu:
index.htm / index.css
  pulled an example from an online source (MIT License) and 
  customized it(butchered, really) to create this menu as a first draft.
  
  Double column menu:
  doubleRow.htm / doubleRow.css
    revisited the menu, changed the structure to give two columns, makes it
    much more compact, user friendly and responsive
    re-wrote the CSS because I have a much better understanding than I did
    several weeks ago when I created the first menu

Double column menu, improved:
doubleColumn.htm / doubleColumn.css
  changed title image to CSS styled text
